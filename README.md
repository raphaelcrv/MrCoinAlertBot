# MrCoinAlertBot
This is a very simple Bot to monitor FoxBit and dispatch alert's

Dont loose good oportunities to buy or sell BTC on FoxBit so this BOT will be scanning the current prices on their API if it reaches my threshold it will send message for you on telegram so you can take manual action.
